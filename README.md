A javafx desktop application that presents the user with the weather at 
their current location. Written in Java, the application 
uses the Visual Crossing Weather API to get the latest weather 
forecast information as well as alerts in the area. The application presents
the information taken from the Visual Crossing Weather API in a clean 
and organized fashion to its users.
